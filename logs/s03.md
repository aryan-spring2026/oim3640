# Session 3 (1/27) - [Chapter 1: Programming as a way of thinking]

## New learnings
[In class, I was thrilled to learn basic functions to work with inside the terminal. Terminal basics such as cd .., dir, and cd folder are useful functions to know when working within a folder and accessing specific files. Furthermore, I learned the difference between and int and a float. The key difference between the two is the value of the decimal (int has .00 and float has .12 for example)]

## Where did I struggle and how did I try to solve the problem?
[While reading the book, I was slightly confused with the modulo concept. I did not understand how the computations were calculated from a mathematical perspective. Hence, once I finished reading Chapter 1, I reviewed the lecture slides from class and took notes. Once I read the examples and computations to determine the calculations, I began to grasp the concept of modulos.]

## Utilization of AI
[I did not use AI.]

## Future Questions
[How can operators be utilized for mathematical reasonsing from a large scale perspective? How is one able to compute harder mathematical calculations and expressions using the operators we have learnt?]
