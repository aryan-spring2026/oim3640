# Session 1 (1/20) - [Introduction to Course]

## New learnings
[During class, I was able to understand the motivation behind taking this course. As someone who comes from a non-traditional coding background, I was slightly worried on how I'll be able to learn a new concept so easily. However, the session today helped me understand the motivation behind understanding principles of human coding and how to use technology to assist me.]

## Where did I struggle and how did I try to solve the problem?
[As I had listed myself for the Computer Science for Business Course, I found it difficult to work with different installation applications of the same software. I was running into problems with both VS Code, the terminals, and Anaconda. Therefore, I decided to email Professor Li and he assisted me with appropriate next steps.]

## Utilization of AI resources
[I did not use AI.]

## Future Questions
[How would the projects we complete for this course help us during interviews and future jobs? Will this couse assist me with another lense of computational thinking?]
