# Session 5 (2/3) - [Chapter 3: Functions]

## New learnings
[Today, I understood the two different types of function scopes. The first one is a local variable. Within the local variable, it is created inside the function and dies when the function is over. The second one is a global variable. Within a global variable, it is created outside a function and is accessible throughout different areas within your code and project. According to the lecture, we are advised to work within local variables.]

## Where did I struggle and how did I try to solve the problem?
[Today, I felt slightly confused when we were working on the tax problem in class. I did not understand the purpose of using def and return commands. In order to sharpen my understanding of these concepts, I reviewed the lecture slides and watched YouTube videos on specific Python syntax.]

## Utilization of AI
[I did not use AI.]

## Future Questions
[Why should we not engage with global variables? If call functions are similar or used excessively, would that cause a problem within our code/understanding of course concepts?]
