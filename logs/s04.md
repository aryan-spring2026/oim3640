# Session 4 (1/29) - [Chapter 2: Variables and Statements]

## New learnings
[Today, I understood the strategic use of when to place comments within your code. While you work on projects that are going to be posted on a public repository within your GitHub, it is important that users understand the significance behind your code and why you have wrote specific lines within your latest version.]

## Where did I struggle and how did I try to solve the problem?
[Today, I felt as if I did not struggle as much from a learning perspective. However, I feel as if I can improve with my time management. As a new coder, I must understand that these chapters are in alignment with one another. Therefore, I have made a schedule per week to spend a minimum of an hour or two to review key concepts from class and lecture slides.]

## Utilization of AI
[I did not use AI.]

## Future Questions
[How can non-technical business years understand the relevance of expressions and statements when creating a new web application from a non-mathematical lens? Do scientists use these applications with complex mathematical subjects such as multi-variable calculus or linear algebra?]
