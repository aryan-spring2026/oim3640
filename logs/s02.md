# Session 2 (1/22) - [Version Control and GitHub]

## New learnings
[Today, I learned that version control is the main application that allows for us to successfully edit, change, and view our software systems in an updated and organized way. Furthermore, I understood that GitHub is the best provider for git as it allows one to utilize markdown features and the platform is cost convenient.]

## Where did I struggle and how did I try to solve the problem?
[One challenge that I faced was with respect to understanding the files in my repository after I commited them. Files such as README.md and .gitignore were difficult to understand. However, to understand their significance, I reviewed the lecture slides and used Google/YouTube to reinforce a correct idea of their applications.]

## Utilization of AI
[I did not use AI.]

## Future Questions
[In the next three years, how will the growth of AI assist GitHub with version control? Is there a significant difference between GitHub and BitBucket/GitLab]
